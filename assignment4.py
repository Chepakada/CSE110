#put float(input()) instead of int(input()) because it accepts all the data whereas int only takes integers.
#It tends to take input on number as string
# if we just declare a varible with a number, it makes a string for "", /
# if not it takes as interger if no decimel else it makes it a float.
#str() makes a number string
#if you put {y:.3f} in the print statement, it is gonna give a decimal value. In this case,/
#  it gives a decimal places with a floating number.
#floor devison as // is the divison without reminder.
# modulo is given by % 
#exponent is given by **
